# Whalom Park
This was an interesting one. We spent a while building an application dealing with Firebase as a team, and then inherited another team's project! The process of weeding through someone else's code took some getting used to, but I'm happy with the end result. The idea was to build an administration site for an imaginary theme park where a user could do things like logging in and out, performing CRUD functions on staff, visitors, rides, and vendors, assigning staff to rides and vendors, and displaying a log of randomly generated expenditures at rides and vendors by visitors. My primary contributions related to the functionality of adding staff members to rides and displaying information relevant to those connections on each page, as well as refactoring code to be as reusable and readable as possible.
